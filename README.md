# CommandParser

##Extrensibility:
App has a factory/strategy structure. All methods are isolated from the client.

Creating a new command:
  1. Create a new Class that inherits Command (abstract). 
  2. Add a new command to the dictionary of CommandBuilder. 
  3. Enjoy.
  
  PS: no need to update Help or any other file.
